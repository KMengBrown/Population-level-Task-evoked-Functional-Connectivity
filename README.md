# Population-level-Task-evoked-Functional-Connectivity

* Description: This repository is devoted to the ptFCE and AMUSE-ptFCE algorithms. These algorithms come from the paper "Population-level Task-evoked Functional Connectivity" by Kun Meng and Ani Eloyan (hereafter ME). This paper is available at XXX.

* Depends R (>= 3.0)

* Maintainer: Kun Meng <kun_meng@brown.edu> 

In addition to this "README" file, there are two files in this repository.

1. "ptFCE and AMUSE-ptFCE Algorithms.R": This file contains functions "ptFCE" and "AMUSE_ptFCE." These two functions implement Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively, of ME.
2. "Simulation Iluustrations.R": This file illustrates the implement of functions "ptFCE" and "AMUSE_ptFCE" using simulations.
